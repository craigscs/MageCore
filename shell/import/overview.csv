Axler,N,1050588,"The Axler Robin 20 Stabilizer S lets you capture smooth, free-floating handheld shots with camcorders and camera rigs weighing up to 7 pounds. The system employs a height-adjustable gimbal and three-stage center column which collapses to a compact, travel-ready size for convenient transport. The center column also makes it easy to balance heavier loads without increasing the weight of the stabilizer, letting you shoot for longer periods of time with less arm fatigue. Four counterweights are included, which fit onto two posts at the base of the stabilizer. 
The camera platform features a quick release plate for easy camera attachment, and allows for front-to-back and side-to-side adjustments for quick balancing. Once balanced, the stabilizer isolates the camera from your body movements, letting you walk or even climb stairs, all while capturing smooth, elegant-looking footage. The weight plate is outfitted with four rubber feet that can be rotated to reveal metal spikes. When you need to set the unit down, the feet offer a stable base for the stabilizer to stand upright on nearly any terrain.

Axler,N,1149085,"The WISP-20M from Axler is a handheld motorized gimbal stabilizer designed for use with mirrorless or similarly sized cameras. It utilizes quiet brushless motors to isolate your camera from unwanted hand shake along the yaw (pan), pitch (tilt), and roll axes, allowing you capture smooth, fully stabilized shots with camera and lens combinations weighing up to 1.9 lb.

The gimbal stabilizer offers two distinct operating modes: a Follow Mode that allows the camera to smoothly follow the pan and tilt motion of the unit, and a Lock Mode to keep the camera in a single position, regardless of how the stabilizer is moved. A thumbstick on the back of the handle is used to switch between modes and adjust camera pan and pitch tilt. Additionally, a button on the camera platform activates a Low mode, lettings you invert the stabilizer for easier low-angle shots.

Designed for ease of use, the WISP-20M features a sliding quick release plate for quick camera attachment and balancing. An offset adapter plate is included to fit wider cameras or cameras with an off-center 1/4&quot;-20 socket. Once balanced, the internal gyros automatically stabilize your camera when the device is powered on. The motors are powered using three readily available 18650 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which provide around 2 to 3 hours of continuous operation. Batteries and a micro-USB charging cable are included.

For added versatility, there is a 3/8&quot;-16 threaded socket at the bottom of the handle that allows the stabilizer to be mounted on a tripod, monopod, or jib.

Axler,N,1253101,"Enjoy the trend towards mobility in the video world? Like being able to carry all your equipment in one bag? Well, here's a major addition to portability, the Foldable Crane Slider from Axler. But, its portability is just one of its features.

You can achieve smooth and steady linear slides, as well as parabolic slides--where the camera pans along with the slide while keeping the subject in frame. And, all this is done by moving a comfortable knob handle to one side or the other. The Foldable Crane Slider is designed for medium-sized DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, and supports a max payload of 4.5 lb.

The slider attaches to your tripod facing forward, slides from the middle to either side a distance of 14&quot;, and extends out to 28&quot; from end to end. Using an included ball head, mount your camera on the &quot;Linear&quot; mounting point on the very front of the slider, and move it back to the &quot;Parabolic&quot; position for panning slides. Both positions offer a 1/4&quot;-20 mounting screw. The ball head is compact and made of aluminum, but you can use any other matching ball head if you'd like.

When you're done and ready to pack the slider away, just set the lock into position, and the slider will stay folded in your bag.

Axler,N,1271174,"The VM-2370CF/VH-11 Spruce from Axler is a professional video-support kit that includes a carbon fiber monopod with feet and a counterbalanced fluid head.

With numerous different functions available to the user, the VM-2370CF/VH-11 can be used in a variety of ways as support for both video and stills. In its native configuration the monopod uses a ball-jointed foot to smoothly pan and pivot without staggering or troublesome vibration. Three fold-away feet attached to the bottom of the base help to provide stability on nearly any surface and can be locked in place along with the ball-joint to give the monopod semi-standing capability.

Accompanying the monopod's pivoting foot is the VH-11 fluid head to provide the user with smooth pans and tilts from the top of the monopod, which complements the base's pivoting foot. Equipped with a long, adjustable handle, the user can accurately guide and control the head's fluid movement to simulate short tracking and boom effects. The head also features a dual lock control system to enable locking of the pan or tilt functions separately, giving the user greater control over their camera's movements.

In addition to the head's integrated features, the VH-11 also utilizes a proprietary sliding quick release plate for rapid mounting and dismounting of your camera. The sliding function allows the user to precisely balance their camera's load on top of the head, allowing the integrated counterweight springs to level the rig, preventing unwanted shake and jitters. It should also be noted that the head is fully removable from the monopod and may be mounted to any support which features a standard 3/8""-16 male thread.

Technical specifications of the rig include a load capacity of 11 lb, a maximum height of 80"" and a closed length of just 28"", perfect for storage or transport. The 4-section carbon fiber leg design helps to keep the rig not only compact but also lightweight, as it weighs in at just 4.4 lb.",,"The <b>VM-2370CF/VH-11 Spruce</b> from <b>Axler</b> is a professional video-support kit that includes a carbon fiber monopod with feet and a counterbalanced fluid head.<br><br>

The translucent material is used to diffuse light, producing a broad light source and a soft, wraparound effect that's perfect for outdoor portraits or whenever a softer light is needed. White produces an even, neutral-colored bounce light that works beautifully as a fill light source for both product shots and indoor/outdoor portraits. Gold produces a natural, golden fill that is great for jewelry and indoor portraits. Silver increases the specular highlights and yields a high-contrast image.

The LiteTrek 4.0 will give you an impressive 650 full power flashes or 3,500 1/64th power flashes on a single 4-hour charge. Recycling times are from 1.0 - 3.5 seconds. Unlike other battery systems, the Mini LT's battery separates from the power module with a simple ""push and slide"" action which is reminiscent of a camera quick release. You can pack additional batteries alone without the extra weight of a second or third full battery system. Besides reducing the weight this also reduces the cost; the battery alone is less than &#189; the price of the complete system.</p>
<p>The Battery pack set comes with separate power module, battery pack, multi-voltage charger, a dedicated cable for Canon 600EX-RT, 580EX II, 580EX, 550EX, MR-14EX, and MT-24EX flashes plus a case with a shoulder strap.",,
Impact,N,766494,"The black Light Kit Bag #2 (34 x 13.5 x 12"") from Impact makes transporting your lighting kit easy and secure. The bag is designed to hold three monolights along with their reflectors (such as Impact VC500LR), four stands, boom, umbrellas, cables and other support gear but can also be used to hold other lighting equipment instead. You'll have plenty of room to take along enough lighting gear for a portrait session - all packed in an organized and accessible way.

The Light Kit Bag is carried by its two 2&quot; wide overlapping top carry handles that can easily be extended into dual shoulder straps. The contents are accessed via dual zippers that when placed together will accept a user-supplied lock. For even more protection, the bottom of the bag contains three rubber feet for when the bag is placed on the ground.

Impact,N,896147,"If you had to choose a single light shaping tool, you might do well to pick the Impact 7' Parabolic Umbrella (Silver) With Light Stand Kit from B&amp;H Photo. In addition to the large 7' umbrella, this kit includes a 9.5' light stand, a triple-flash adapter mount, and an umbrella bracket with an adjustable shoe.
This 7' parabolic umbrella is a really huge, broad light source that wraps light around your subject, yielding clean highlights and rich open shadows. But due to the special shape of the umbrella there's a unique mix of soft enveloping light with the kind of crisp detail you only get from reflectors. Put another way, if you combined a beauty dish with a softbox, you'd have a parabolic umbrella.
This umbrella has a unique design structurally as well. The shaft is reinforced for strength and instead of bendable metal, and the 16 inner ribs are made of durable fiberglass. The fixed black backing ensures that all of the light output is on your subject instead of through the umbrella. The silver interior provides a more specular and contrasty look than a white umbrella. You can also vary the light-to-umbrella distance along the shaft for a harder or softer light. This silver version is ideal for throwing the light over a long distance. Two of them, for instance could light an entire auditorium or a large graduating class. With the Impact 7' Parabolic Umbrella less is definitely more.
The Impact 9.5' light stand is heavy-duty black aluminum, with sure-twist section locks and air cushioning. Air cushioning gently lowers the light, preventing damage to light fixtures and fingers when section locks have not been properly tightened.
The Impact FA-300HS Triple-Flash Hot Shoe Adapter Mount allows you to mount, sync and fire up to three flashes from this single adapter. You can fire the flashes at full power for greater light output or, for faster recycle times, fire them at half power to conserve the energy. This unique adapter features a female 1/4&quot;-20 thread for universal mounting, and may be combined with an umbrella, light panel, or other lighting accessories (all sold separately).
The Impact Umbrella Bracket with Adjustable Shoe is a versatile, lightweight metal bracket that includes a removable, reversible female stud to adapt to light stands with top studs smaller than the standard 5/8&quot;.

In addition to the large&nbsp;7' umbrella, this kit includes a 9.5' light stand, a triple-flash adapter mount, and an umbrella bracket with an adjustable shoe.</p>
<p>This 7' parabolic umbrella is a really huge, broad light source that wraps light around your subject, yielding clean highlights and rich open shadows. But due to the special shape of the umbrella there's a unique mix of soft enveloping light with the kind of crisp detail you only get from reflectors. Put another way, if you combined a beauty dish with a softbox, you'd have a parabolic umbrella.</p>
<p>This umbrella has a unique design structurally as well. The shaft is reinforced for strength and instead of bendable metal, the 16 inner ribs are made of durable fiberglass. The fixed black backing ensures that all of the light output is on your subject instead of through the umbrella. You can also vary the light-to-umbrella distance along the shaft for a harder or softer look or for longer throw capability. With the Impact 7' Parabolic Umbrella less is definitely more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Impact 9.5' light stand is heavy-duty black aluminum, with sure-twist section locks and air cushioning. Air cushioning gently lowers the light, preventing damage to light fixtures and fingers when section locks have not been properly tightened.</p>
<p>The Impact FA-300HS Triple-Flash Hot Shoe Adapter Mount allows you to mount, sync and fire up to three flashes from this single adapter. You can fire the flashes at full power for greater light output or, for faster recycle times, fire them at half power to conserve the energy. This unique adapter features a female 1/4&quot;-20 thread for universal mounting, and may be combined with an umbrella, light panel, or other lighting accessories (all sold separately).</p>
<p>The Impact Umbrella Bracket with Adjustable Shoe is a versatile, lightweight metal bracket that includes a removable, reversible female stud to adapt to light stands with top studs smaller than the standard 5/8&quot;. An additional removable, reversible male stud mounts to the included flash shoe at the 1/4&quot;-20 end, or to another accessory at the 3/8&quot; end.

Well, now you don't have to; this Impact 7' Parabolic 3 Umbrella Kit has them all - white interior with black backing, silver interior with black backing and white translucent.

What all of them have in common is that they're really huge, broad light sources that wrap light around your subject yielding clean highlights and rich open shadows. Due to the special shape of the umbrellas there's a unique mix of soft enveloping light with the kind of crisp detail you only get from reflectors.

7' Parabolic Umbrella (White/Black) 


The fixed black backing on the white/black version ensures that all of the light output is on your subject instead of through the umbrella. You can also vary the light-to-umbrella distance along the shaft for a harder or softer look or for longer throw capability.

7' Parabolic Umbrella (Silver) 


The silver interior version provides a more specular and contrasty look than the white umbrella. Again, you can also vary the light-to-umbrella distance along the shaft for a harder or softer light. This silver version is ideal for throwing the light over a long distance. Two of them, for instance could light an entire auditorium or a large graduating class.

7' Parabolic Umbrella (White Diffusion) 


The white translucent version of this umbrella yields the softest light. Used in standard bounce mode, some of the light escapes through the material, slightly raising the ambient light level and lowering contrast while most of it is directed towards your subject. If you want a harder light, turn the umbrella around and aim the convex side at your subject and punch your light source through it.",,"If you had to choose a single light shaping tool, you might do well to pick an Impact 7' Parabolic Umbrella.

Impact,N,912757,"This Impact 22"" Beauty Dish Reflector Kit is comprised of the Impact 22"" Beauty Dish with a deflector, diffusion sock and a honeycomb grid. The kit is configured to provide photographers with a creative means to augment this unique light shaping tool.

The Beauty Dish offers a bridge between a softbox and an umbrella that yields soft but crisp light with snappy contrast and a textural quality that flatters makeup on models and accentuates character in portrait subjects. The secret is a included deflector that bounces the flash's direct output backwards, filling the shallow dish and casting a wide beam of soft light forward. This reflector renders natural-looking round catchlights in the subject's eyes rather than square or rectangular ones.

For a bit more control affix the provided grid to the Beauty Dish for increased directionality and spill light management. The grid gathers the light output into a large soft spot that allows you to create intricately lit background details and painterly effects.

Yet another kind of light is available by removing the grid and slipping on the Diffusion Sock. This gives the dish a wider angle of coverage and softer detail while it masks the deflector which might be seen in the catchlights in extreme closeups.

Impact,N,1002771,"When describing the aptly-named 400Ws Astral Extreme AS-X-400 Monolight from  Impact the operative word is speed. The light is designed so you'll never miss a shot while waiting for it to recycle. Recycling time is a fast 0.4 seconds at full power, flash duration is an impressive 1/5,000 of a second, and continuous shooting speed can reach a rapid-fire 10 frames per second. This strong emphasis on speed makes the Astral Extreme a smart choice for fashion and event shooting and since it's fast enough to capture almost any movement at its peak, it's ideal for high-speed photography. You can even bring the Astral Extreme on location, powering it from a generator or inverter if there's no AC power available.Easy might be the next way to describe AS-X-400. Adjustments are easily made on the light's back panel which incorporates a carry handle. Soft push buttons control the modeling light, ready beep, and optical slave on/off function. The slave allows you set Instant-Fire or Skip Pre-flash modes and trigger the flash head at distances up to 33'. You can also hard wire the AS-X-400 to your camera via the included 1/4&quot; phono sync cord, or easier still, use an optional wireless radio system such as Impact's ControlSync 16 to trigger the flash from up to 150' away and remotely control its power, modeling and audible alert.The Astral Extreme's power level, which is adjustable in 1/10 stops over a 6 stop range is displayed on an easy-to-read LCD screen. Both power and modeling lamp intensity are adjustable via simple knobs. The 150W modeling light dims when the flash is triggered while a switchable beep indicates full recycling.A handy feature of the AS-X-400 is the adjustable mounting bracket that allows you to find the center of gravity for better balance when using heavy front accessories such as large softboxes. A built-in receiver can support umbrella shafts up to 8mm and umbrellas up to 7' in diameter. The speedring/reflector mount is S-type, providing you with a wide range of choices, not only from Impact but from the many manufacturers who have standardized on this mount.

Impact,N,1022371,"The  PowerSync 16-80 Transceiver from  Impact is a combination wireless transmitter/receiver with 80 channels for elimination of interference, as well as 4 groups that can each handle multiple devices that can be triggered individually or simultaneously. Besides remote flash triggering, with the appropriate optional cable, the PowerSync 16-80 can focus and trigger your camera in single, continuous, and bulb modes or be used as a wireless shutter release.The PowerSync 16-80 is used with at least 1 other unit. In its most basic mode, one transceiver slides onto the camera's hot shoe or is mounted to a bracket's cold shoe and is connected to the camera using the included 2.5mm to PC cable. A second transceiver acts as a receiver and accepts a shoe mount flash using its built-in hot shoe or is wired to the flash in the case of power packs or monolight. The connected flash will fire at distances up to 720'. You can even extend the range further by adding a third intermediate transceiver to extend the range to 1,440'.A similar technique is used to fire your camera remotely by connecting a transceiver to it using an optional dedicated cable - a handy feature for macro photography. Add another handheld PowerSync 16-80 to trigger the camera remotely, like a wireless cable release. Pressing the release button halfway focuses the camera; fully depressing it triggers the shutter. Taking this a step further, you can fire the camera and a flash remotely with just 3 transceivers - one connected to the camera, one to the flash, and one handheld acting as a transmitter.The long exposure mode brings you into the realm of the unit's additional features. With a wired transceiver or a wireless 2-tranceiver setup, depressing the bulb button activates a digital stopwatch on the LCD screen that indicates elapsed time. Stop the exposure by depressing the button fully.Ideal for surveillance or wildlife photography using a remote camera, Continuous Focus Lock minimizes triggering lag time by locking the camera into focus mode, similar to depressing the camera's focus release button half way. With the PowerSync 16-80, you'll never have to miss a shot because you had to wake a sleeping camera.The grouping function allows you to assign each light in a portrait setup to one of the 4 groups allowing you to use all of the lights in unison or to add or subtract an accent, hairlight or backlight, for example, at will for different effects. Alternatively, you can assign a channel to 4 different lighting setups in a large studio and move from setup to setup for different looks or products. Each setup would require at least 1 transceiver wired to a master light to set off the optical slaves on the other units. With its reasonable cost you could, of course, wire a transceiver to each flash in the studio.The PowerSync 16-80 runs on 2 included, easily-sourced AA batteries.

When describing the aptly-named 400Ws Astral Extreme the operative word is speed. The light is designed so you'll never miss a shot while waiting for it to recycle. Recycling time is a fast 0.4 seconds at full power, flash duration is an impressive 1/5,000 of a second, and continuous shooting speed can reach a rapid-fire 10 frames per second. This strong emphasis on speed makes the Astral Extreme a smart choice for fashion and event shooting and since it's fast enough to capture almost any movement at its peak, it's ideal for high-speed photography. You can even bring the Astral Extreme on location, powering it from a generator or inverter if there's no AC power available.

Easy might be the next way to describe AS-X-400. Adjustments are easily made on the light's back panel which incorporates a carry handle. Soft push buttons control the modeling light, ready beep, and optical slave on/off function. The slave allows you set Instant-Fire or Skip Pre-flash modes and trigger the flash head at distances up to 33'. You can also hard wire the AS-X-400 to your camera via the included 1/4"" phono sync cord, or easier still, use an optional wireless radio system such as Impact's ControlSync 16 to trigger the flash from up to 150' away and remotely control its power, modeling light and audible alert.

 
The Astral Extreme's power level, which is adjustable in 1/10 stops over a 6 stop range, is displayed on an easy-to-read LCD screen. Both power and modeling lamp intensity are adjustable via simple knobs. The 150W modeling light dims when the flash is triggered while a switchable beep indicates full recycling.

A handy feature of the AS-X-400 is the adjustable mounting bracket that allows you to find the center of gravity for better balance when using heavy front accessories such as large softboxes.

Impact,N,1091038,"The Impact PowerSync 16-80 Transceiver 2-Pack Kit was put together by B&amp;H to provide a complete wireless triggering solution for photographers on location or in the studio. The kit includes 80-channel PowerSync transceivers both of which, as the name implies, can be used as a receiver or a transmitter. Each unit comes with a lanyard, pouch case, 3.5 mm and 2.5 mm synch cables, 3.5 to 1/4&quot; adapter, 2 AA batteries and a self-adhering accessory shoe.The PowerSync 16-80 Transceiver is a combination wireless transmitter/receiver with 80 channels for elimination of interference, as well as 4 groups that can each handle multiple devices that can be triggered individually or simultaneously. Besides remote flash triggering, with the appropriate optional cable, the PowerSync 16-80 can focus and trigger your camera in single, continuous, and bulb modes or be used as a wireless shutter release.The PowerSync 16-80 is used with at least one other unit. In its most basic mode, one transceiver slides onto the camera's hot shoe or is mounted to a bracket's cold shoe and is connected to the camera using the included 2.5mm to PC cable. A second transceiver acts as a receiver and accepts a shoe mount flash using its built-in hot shoe or is wired to the flash in the case of power packs or monolight. The connected flash will fire at distances up to 720'. You can even extend the range further by adding a third intermediate transceiver to extend the range to 1,440'.A similar technique is used to fire your camera remotely by connecting a transceiver to it using an optional dedicated cable - a handy feature for macro photography. Add another handheld PowerSync 16-80 to trigger the camera remotely, like a wireless cable release. Pressing the release button halfway focuses the camera; fully depressing it triggers the shutter. Taking this a step further, you can fire the camera and a flash remotely with just 3 transceivers - one connected to the camera, one to the flash, and one handheld acting as a transmitter.The long exposure mode brings you into the realm of the unit's additional features. With a wired transceiver or a wireless 2-tranceiver setup, depressing the bulb button activates a digital stopwatch on the LCD screen that indicates elapsed time. Stop the exposure by depressing the button fully.Ideal for surveillance or wildlife photography using a remote camera, Continuous Focus Lock minimizes triggering lag time by locking the camera into focus mode, similar to depressing the camera's focus release button half way.

Impact,N,1107548,"The Impact Astral Extreme 2 Light Portrait Kit was put together by B&amp;H to provide an out of the box solution for photographers doing portraits, groups, or fashion. The kit is built around two 400Ws flash heads that recycle to full power in 0.4 sec., each with reflectors, flash tubes, and a 10' air-cushioned light stand. A 45&quot; umbrella with a removable black back and a 39&quot; Luxbanx Duo deep octagonal softbox with speedring and grid are also included.When describing the Astral Extreme AS-X-400 Monolight from Impact the key word is speed. Recycling time is a fast 0.4 seconds at full power, flash duration is an impressive 1/5,000 of a second, and continuous shooting speed can reach a rapid-fire 10 frames per second. This strong emphasis on speed makes the Astral Extreme a smart choice for fashion and event shooting, and since it's fast enough to capture almost any movement at its peak, it is ideal for high-speed photography. You can even bring the Astral Extreme on location, powering it from a generator or inverter if there's no AC power available. The Astral Extreme's power level, which is adjustable in 1/10 stops over a 6-stop range is displayed on an easy-to-read LCD screen. Both power and modeling lamp intensity are adjustable via simple knobs. A handy feature of the Astra is the adjustable mounting bracket that allows you to find the center of gravity for better balance when using heavy front accessories such as large softboxes.

The kit includes 2 of Impact's 80 channel PowerSync 16-80 Transceivers and an Impact PowerSync Pre-Trigger cable. TransceiverThe PowerSync 16-80 Transceiver is a combination wireless transmitter/receiver with 80 channels for elimination of interference, as well as 4 groups that each handle multiple devices that can be triggered individually or simultaneously. Besides remote flash triggering, with the appropriate optional cable, the PowerSync 16-80 can focus and trigger your camera in single, continuous, and bulb modes or be used as a wireless shutter release.The PowerSync 16-80 is used with at least 1 other unit. In its most basic mode, one (included in kit) transceiver slides onto the camera's hot shoe or is mounted to a bracket's cold shoe and is connected to the camera using the included 2.5mm to PC cable. A second (included in kit) transceiver acts as a receiver and accepts a shoe mount flash using its built-in hot shoe or is wired to the flash in the case of power packs or monolight. The connected flash will fire at distances up to 720'.A similar technique is used to fire your camera remotely by connecting a transceiver to it using the included dedicated cable - a handy feature for macro photography. Add another handheld PowerSync 16-80 to trigger the camera remotely, like a wireless cable release. Pressing the release button halfway focuses the camera; fully depressing it triggers the shutter. Taking this a step further, you can fire the camera and a flash remotely with just 3 transceivers - one connected to the camera, one to the flash, and one handheld acting as a transmitter.The long exposure mode brings you into the realm of the unit's additional features. With a wired transceiver or a wireless 2-transceiver setup, depressing the bulb button activates a digital stopwatch on the LCD screen that indicates elapsed time. Stop the exposure by depressing the button fully.Ideal for surveillance or wildlife photography using a remote camera, Continuous Focus Lock minimizes triggering lag time by locking the camera into focus mode, similar to depressing the camera's focus release button half way. With the PowerSync 16-80, you'll never have to miss a shot because you had to wake a sleeping camera.The grouping function allows you to assign each light in a portrait setup to one of the 4 groups allowing you to use all of the lights in unison or to add or subtract an accent, hairlight or backlight, for example, at will for different effects. Alternatively, you can assign a channel to 4 different lighting setups in a large studio and move from setup to setup for different looks or products. Each setup would require at least 1 transceiver wired to a master light to set off the optical slaves on the other units. With its reasonable cost you could, of course, wire a transceiver to each flash in the studio.The PowerSync 16-80 runs on 2 included, easily-sourced AA batteries.

Impact,N,1161289,"The 16"" Impact Beauty Dish with Impact EX100 / Elinchrom / Interfit EX Mount was put together by B&H to make the unique quality of light produced by this reflector available to users of these lights. The kit includes the Beauty Dish and an adapter specific to the lights.

Popularized by fashion and portrait photographers, the beauty dish reflector offers a bridge between softboxes and umbrellas that yields a soft but crisp light with snappy contrast and a textural quality that flatters makeup on models and accentuates character in portrait subjects. The key to its light quality is a built-in deflector that bounces the flash's direct output backwards, filling the shallow dish and casting a wide beam of soft light forward. The Beauty Dish can also be used in combination with an optional diffuser sock or honeycomb grid, which allows for further modification of the light output. The Beauty Dish in this kit fits Impact EX100, Elinchrom, Interfit EX and Calumet Genesis flash heads.

Impact,N,1213557,"The Impact 20"" Pivot Arm with Super Clamp Kit was put together by B&H to offer photographers and videographers an articulating, hands-free solution to support a light or other grip accessory. The kit includes a 20"" pivot arm with lever-type locking and a Super Clamp with a 5/8"" stud, and 1/4""-20 male-to-male and 1/4""-20 to shoe mount adapters.

The Pivot Arm is a natural choice for use with a Super Clamp to free up floor space by clamping to a pole or other element on location such as a door. In total 360 degrees of movement is possible. 

 
The Super Clamp with Ratchet Handle is a versatile grip tool that can support 
cameras, lights, umbrellas, hooks, shelves, cross bars and other grip gear weighing up to 33 lb. The Super Clamp can be securely mounted on any tube or pipe from 0.5"" to 2.1"" and is supplied with a wedge insert for clamping onto flat surfaces.

The reflector is built around a translucent disc which doesn't reflect as much as the solid white surface, but does exhibit soft neutral reflection. Its primary purpose, however, is as a diffuser that will tame contrast by being held over a subject's head in the harsh noon-day sun. The disc can also be used in situations where you'd use a softbox. Using a disc holder or one of the 3/8&quot; sockets, place your flash or constant light behind the suspended disc for soft, flattering light with open shadows.</p><p>The 5-in-1 reflector has handy convenience features that make it easy to use and deliver impressive results, while saving space by folding down to approximately one third of its open size.

A 2-second delay mode is ideal for self-portraits. 16,000,000 possible radio channels ensure that you'll always have a clear signal (there are no dip switches to set--the device configures at the push of a button).
Because this is a radio remote, it can trigger your camera up to 320' (100 m) away, even when it's not in the line of sight of the transmitter (unlike infrared remote controls). You can even trigger your camera from around a corner! Not only can you trigger your shutter with this set, you can set autofocus and trip the shutter using the dual-function release; take multiple shots with a single press of the trigger; control the length of a long exposure; delay the trigger for 2 seconds; trigger your camera either wirelessly or wired (wired triggering works even if the battery in the receiver is dead or missing!); and (with additional optional receivers) trigger multiple cameras at the same time.
LED indicators confirm pre-focus and exposure. The transmitter operates on a 23A 12V battery that will last 3 years under normal circumstances. The receiver uses a CR2 3V battery that's good for approximately 20,000 triggers. The included cable releases work with a wide variety of Nikon cameras, as well as select Fuji and Kodak cameras.

Vello,N,823700,"The Vello FreeWave Viewer Wireless Live View Remote for Nikon contains a 3.5"" live view TFT-LCD monitor and 2.4GHz radio transmitter to provide a wireless viewing system that also enables remote shutter control from a distance up to 200' away from the camera.

The live view monitor features a 3.5"" display with a 320 x 240 resolution that is able to provide a real time view of what your camera is seeing. The monitor's design integrates a remote shutter release button that supports half-press control for pre-focusing and acquiring auto exposure settings. Additionally, an enlarge mode is available for magnifying details within the scene. A dedicated button allows switching between AV (live view) and CCTV modes for different perspectives of monitoring and a channel switch button permits changing between different transmitter channels. A 1/4""-20 tripod socket is located on the bottom of the unit and the brightness of the display can be manually controlled.

The transmitter can be attached to the camera via its hot shoe or to a 1/4""-20 threaded mount and connects to the camera using both an AV and a shutter release cable. The AV connection provides the live view signal for remote viewing on the monitor and the shutter release cable allows for wirelessly releasing the shutter from the monitor. A CCTV camera is also integrated into the transmitter's design and incorporates a 45mm lens (35mm equivalent focal length) to provide a slightly wider-than-normal perspective for viewing subjects in front of the camera. The CCTV camera is especially useful for situations when using a telephoto or long lens to photograph details and monitoring when a moving subject is about to enter the frame. Additionally this camera's functionality is ideal for use when the connected camera does not support live view or if trying to conserve the camera's battery life for extended viewing sessions. The 2.4GHz radio transmitter operates amongst four selectable channels for greater control when more than one unit is being used within 200' proximity.

Included with the transmitter and monitor are both AV and shutter release cables, which allow live view monitoring and shutter control with Nikon D700, D300/300s, D7000, D90, D5200, D5100, D5000, D3200, and D3100 DSLR cameras. If only controlling the shutter via the remote monitor and using the transmitter's CCTV as the viewing source, a wide range of shutter release cables are optionally available.

The FreeWave Plus works in either wired or wireless mode. This is ideal for photographing wildlife, and for macro and close-up photos or long exposures, where the slightest camera movement can ruin a picture. Simply by switching release cables, you can use this remote control with a vast number of different cameras. With the release cables included in this kit, you can use Canon, Contax, Samsung, Pentax and Olympus cameras (see camera compatibility list).

Working on the 2.4GHz frequency gives you reduced radio interference and an extended range (up to 320' (100 m))--you don't need to have line-of-sight alignment, either, as radio waves will pass through walls, windows and floors.

Vello,N,849271,"The Vello FreeWave Fusion Wireless Remote Flash Trigger Kit (Canon/Olympus) from B&amp;H Photo is a versatile, reliable remote control kit that will trigger off-camera flash units and studio lights from up to 300 feet away. It can be used to configure up to three different light groups, which can be triggered individually or simultaneously, for a total of seven different combinations, using its multiple groups feature. Simultaneous triggering of multiple light groups requires additional FreeWave Fusion Receivers (available separately).
The FreeWave Fusion also provides the convenience of a wireless camera shutter release, ideal for photographing wildlife, and also for macro and close-up photos or long exposures, where the slightest camera movement can ruin a picture. Working on the 2.4GHz frequency gives you reduced radio interference and an extended range (up to 320' (100 m)) - you don't need to have line-of-sight alignment, either, as radio waves will pass through walls, windows and floors.
The included cable releases are compatible with the following cameras:

Vello,N,849272,"Whether capturing images in the studio or on location, the Vello FreeWave Wireless Remote Shutter Release Kit (Canon/Olympus/Pentax) from B&amp;H Photo adds flexibility and versatility to your shooting style. Photography unplugged - shooters can interact with a model, view the scene or set from alternate angles, or set a camera by a stream to capture an image of a bear hunting while you remain at a safe distance away - all this and more without missing a beat, a shot, or a moment.
This particular FreeWave unit is compatible with cameras with a sub-mini connection, i.e. Canon EOS Rebel series, 60D, &amp; PowerShot G1 X, Contax N and 645, Pentax K and DS series, Samsung GX series DSLRs, and Olympus E-1, E-3, and E-5 cameras.
This versatile shutter release features Smart Code technology which allows it to be configured to operate on up to 16 million possible radio channels. You can easily switch channels to &quot;zero in&quot; on a frequency that provides optimal range and functionality.
The FreeWave operates with radio frequency (RF) technology, therefore a direct line of sight is not necessary; radio waves pass through objects such as windows and walls. It is unlike other wireless remotes on the market that operate on an Infrared (IR) system and require a direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver to make things work.
Since touching the camera even lightly while capturing an image can create a blurred image, the FreeWave eliminates this by tripping the shutter without any disturbances. This is critical when photographing subjects close up, and for long-exposures and macros. It is also extremely valuable when photographing nature, wildlife and other subjects that are difficult for you to get close to.

Vello,N,883572,"The FreeWave Fusion Pro Wireless Flash Trigger and Remote Control for Canon DSLRs from Vello is a versatile, reliable remote control kit that will trigger off-camera flash units and studio lights from up to 600' away. It can be used to configure up to three different light groups, which can be triggered individually or simultaneously, for a total of seven different combinations, using its multiple groups feature. Simultaneous triggering of multiple lights requires separate purchase of additional FreeWave Fusion Pro Receivers. The FreeWave Fusion Pro also provides the convenience of a wireless camera shutter release, ideal for photographing wildlife, and also for macro and close-up photos or long exposures, where the slightest camera movement can ruin a picture. Working on the 2.4 GHz frequency gives you reduced radio interference and an extended range up to 600', and since radio signals pass through obstructions you don't need to position them in line-of-sight. Four RF channels are available to prevent interference from other users. The FreeWave Fusion Pro is compatible with most cameras, flash units, and studio lights. The transmitter connects to the hot shoe of the camera. In case the hot shoe is needed for another function, the transmitter can alternatively connect to the camera's PC plug via its 3.5mm sync plug (PC cable not included).

Vello,N,980977,"The Vello FreeWave Viewer VL Wireless Live View Remote consists of a 2.4GHz radio transmitter, and a monitor receiver with a 3.5"" Live View TFT-LCD screen. Together, the transmitter and receiver provide a wireless viewing system that enables remote shutter control from a distance of up to 328'/100m. The main feature of this unit is that it can also start and stop video recording on select Canon cameras by means of the optional FW-IRC IR cable.

The live view monitor features a 3.5"" display with a 320 x 240 resolution that is able to provide a view of what your camera is seeing. A removable pop-up shade allows for improved viewing when shooting in direct sunlight or brightly lit situations. The monitor's design integrates a remote shutter release button that supports half-press control for pre-focusing. A dedicated button allows switching between AV (live view) and CCTV modes for different perspectives of monitoring, and a channel switch button permits changing between different transmitter channels. A 1/4""-20 tripod mount is located on the bottom of the unit for hands free viewing. Both the brightness and contrast of the display can be manually controlled.

The transmitter can be attached to the camera via its hot shoe, and connects to the camera using a required data cable. The AV connection provides the live view signal for remote viewing on the monitor and the shutter release connection allows for wirelessly triggering the shutter from the monitor. A CCTV camera is integrated into the transmitter's design and incorporates a 45mm lens (35mm equivalent focal length) to provide another perspective for viewing subjects in front of the camera. The CCTV camera is especially useful to monitor when a moving subject is about to enter the frame for situations when you're using a telephoto or long lens to photograph. Additionally this camera's functionality is ideal for use when the connected camera does not support live view or if trying to conserve the camera's battery life for extended viewing sessions.

Simultaneous triggering of multiple lights requires separate purchase of additional FreeWave Fusion Pro Receivers.The FreeWave Fusion Pro also provides the convenience of a wireless camera shutter release, ideal for photographing wildlife, and also for macro and close-up photos or long exposures where the slightest camera movement can ruin a picture. Working on the 2.4GHz frequency gives you reduced radio interference and an extended range up to 600', and since radio signals pass through obstructions you don't need to position them in line-of-sight.
The FreeWave Fusion Pro is compatible with most cameras, flash units and studio lights. The transmitter connects to the hot shoe of the camera. In case the hot shoe is needed for another function, the transmitter can alternatively connect to the camera's PC plug via its 3.5mm sync plug (PC cable not included). The transmitter also features a top hot shoe, which fully supports E-TTL metering when used with Canon TTL compatible components. This allows you to keep a TTL flash mounted on top of the camera, while using the transmitter to control off-camera flash units (in manual mode) via radio signal.
Note!Since the FreeWave Fusion Pro does not transmit TTL settings, use of a flash or light unit with full manual control is recommended. You will need to set the power output manually. 
The FreeWave Fusion Pro is compatible with most cameras, flash units and studio lights. However, for flash wake-up functionality and/or high shutter speeds, you will need full Canon TTL support via your camera, flash and FreeWave Fusion Pro trigger.

This coiled cord measures 3', which is enough distance to accommodate hand-held lighting styles, or when keeping the flash mounted on a compact flash bracket. Also, off-camera lighting reduces the harsh shadows commonly encountered with direct on-camera flashes and gives your photographs a more natural look.

The Stryker can be mounted directly to the camera via its cold shoe, or it can be mounted to any bracket, rig, or light stand that features a 1/4""-20 screw. The unit comes supplied with two Nikon-compatible cables which connect to the camera's remote control socket. Cables are also available for most other brand SLR cameras. In Lightning Mode simply point the camera and sensor in the direction of the subject and adjust the unit's sensitivity dial until the red light extinguishes. Start with a long exposure, about 10 seconds, and adjust the time as needed. Make sure that your camera is in manual focus mode and focus on infinity. Individual camera shutter lag and exposure settings will determine how fast your camera fires.

For Motion Mode follow the same method as above but manually focus your camera lens on the area where you expect activity. The Stryker uses a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) to detect IR heat sources such as humans or animals from up to 16.4' away.

Vello,N,1181601,"The FreeWave Fusion Kit for Select Nikon & Fuji Cameras from Vello is a versatile, reliable remote control kit that will trigger off-camera flash units and studio lights from up to 300 feet away. It can be used to configure up to three different light groups, which can be triggered individually or simultaneously, for a total of seven different combinations, using its multiple groups feature. Simultaneous triggering of multiple light groups requires additional FreeWave Fusion Receivers (available separately).
The FreeWave Fusion also provides the convenience of a wireless camera shutter release, ideal for photographing wildlife, and also for macro and close-up photos or long exposures, where the slightest camera movement can ruin a picture.

Vello,N,1181602,"Whether capturing images in the studio or on location, the FreeWave Remote Shutter Release Kit for Select Nikon & Fuji Cameras adds flexibility and versatility to your shooting style. Photography unplugged - shooters can interact with a model, view the scene or set from alternate angles, or set a camera by a stream to capture an image of a bear hunting while you remain at a safe distance away - all this and more without missing a beat, a shot, or a moment. This particular FreeWave kit is compatible with cameras equipped with a Nikon 10-pin connection, i.e. Nikon D1, D2, D3, and D4 series DSLRs and can be used with select Fuji cameras via the included 2.5mm Fuji cable.This versatile shutter release features Smart Code technology which allows it to be configured to operate on up to 16 million possible radio channels. You can easily switch channels to &quot;zero in&quot; on a frequency that provides the optimal range and functionality.The FreeWave operates with radio frequency (RF) technology, therefore a direct line of sight is not necessary; radio waves pass through objects such as windows and walls. It is unlike other wireless remotes on the market that operate on an Infrared (IR) system and require a direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver to make things work.Since touching the camera even lightly while capturing an image can create a blurred image, the FreeWave eliminates this by tripping the shutter without any disturbances. This is critical when photographing subjects close up, and for long-exposures and macros. It is also extremely valuable when photographing nature, wildlife, and other subjects that are difficult for you to get close to.

The FreeWave Stryker Lightning & Motion Trigger Kit for Select Nikon & Fuji Cameras from Vello is a solution for both situations in a lightweight, user-friendly package.

Operation is easy. It's important to start with fully charged batteries for maximum performance. The Stryker can be mounted directly to the camera via its cold shoe, or it can be mounted to any bracket, rig, or light stand that features a 1/4""-20 screw. The unit comes supplied with two Nikon-compatible cables which connect to the camera's remote control socket. Cables are also available for most other brand SLR cameras. In Lightning Mode simply point the camera and sensor in the direction of the subject and adjust the unit's sensitivity dial until the red light extinguishes. Start with a long exposure, about 10 seconds, and adjust the time as needed. Make sure that your camera is in manual focus mode and focus on infinity. Individual camera shutter lag and exposure settings will determine how fast your camera fires.

For Motion Mode follow the same method as above but manually focus your camera lens on the area where you expect activity. The Stryker uses a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) to detect IR heat sources such as humans or animals from up to 16.4' away.

Vello,N,1192262,"The FreeWave Orbit from Vello is a programmable motorized pan head which allows the user to capture full 360&deg; panoramic photographs or still or moving product photos.

The Orbit is fully programmable allowing the user to determine the degree angle of rotation, the number of shots taken within that range, the panning speed, and the direction of capture for panoramic photos. Placement of the camera and head is entirely your choice, as the head may be mounted on top of a tripod via the integrated 3/8""-16 female thread or seated on a flat surface using the anti-slip bottom pad.

An ideal tool for the budding 360&deg; panoramic or VR photographer, the Orbit is capable of automatically producing batches of images which may be easily combined to form traditional or interactive media. Operating as a panoramic head and trigger, the Orbit can be programmed to make linear adjustments in up to 360&deg; patterns while automatically triggering the shutter every time the camera pauses. These images can then be stitched together to form multi-image panoramas or immersive 360&deg; virtual tours. Additionally, this function may be used with the optional product plate to create interactive, rotating product tours. 

Included with the Orbit is a 2.4 GHz wireless remote capable of communicating with the head from up to 100' away. Programmable to one of 16 available channels, the user can prevent troublesome radio interference with other electronics or use two Orbit heads in close proximity without issue.

The remote may also be used atop the camera as a camera control unit, capable of triggering the camera's shutter when it is not placed on the Orbit head. Previously mentioned, a common use for this function would be 360&deg; product photography with the optional 8"" product plate&mdash;a rotating stage which can allow a camera in a fixed position to take multiple photos of a small object from up to 72 angles.

Vello,N,1250499,"Timing is everything and if you've ever tried to photograph lightning or wildlife in its natural environment you know it's not easy. The FreeWave Stryker Lightning & Motion Trigger for Select Canon Cameras from Vello is a solution for both situations in a lightweight, user-friendly package. Operation is easy. It's important to start with fully charged batteries for maximum performance. The Stryker can be mounted directly to the camera via its cold shoe, or it can be mounted to any bracket, rig, or light stand that features a 1/4""-20 screw. The unit comes supplied with two Canon-compatible cables which connect to the camera's remote control socket. Cables are also available for most other brand DSLR cameras. In Lightning Mode simply point the camera and sensor in the direction of the subject and adjust the unit's sensitivity dial until the red light extinguishes. Start with a long exposure, about 10 seconds, and adjust the time as needed. Make sure that your camera is in manual focus mode and focus on infinity. Individual camera shutter lag and exposure settings will determine how fast your camera fires. For Motion Mode follow the same method as above but manually focus your camera lens on the area where you expect activity. The Stryker uses a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) to detect IR heat sources such as humans or animals from up to 16.4' away.So whether you're interested in wildlife, motion-stopping experimentation, or sports you'll find the FreeWave Stryker useful and enjoyable.

When using supported G-type and E-type lenses from Nikon, users will have auto exposure as well as the ability to control the aperture from the camera body. Autofocus can be utilized as well (only for photography, not video) and is fastest and most accurate when used with Sony cameras that use focal-plane phase-detect AF systems. Version 4 brings with it optimized autofocus and auto exposure performance among a larger range of lenses. Image stabilization is also supported and will work in tandem with compatible in-body stabilization systems. Users of compatible D-type lenses will have access to auto exposure capabilities and all Nikon lenses will be able to communicate Exif data through the adapter to the camera.

The mount is designed for long-term use with a durable metal construction and it has a matte black interior that will help reduce reflections for optimal image quality. Additionally, it has an integrated tripod foot with a 1/4""-20 socket that can be used to reduce stress on the camera's lens mount when using larger lenses.


 Vello LAE-SE-NFV4 Auto Lens Adapter Lens Compatibility Information (Firmware Ver. 4)

When using supported G-type and E-type lenses from Nikon, users will have auto exposure as well as the ability to control the aperture from the camera body. Autofocus can be utilized as well (only for photography, not video) and is fastest and most accurate when used with Sony cameras that use focal-plane phase-detect AF systems. Version 4 brings with it optimized autofocus and auto exposure performance among a larger range of lenses. Image stabilization is also supported and will work in tandem with compatible in-body stabilization systems. Users of compatible D-type lenses will have access to auto exposure capabilities and all Nikon lenses will be able to communicate Exif data through the adapter to the camera.
<br><br>
The mount is designed for long-term use with a durable metal construction and it has a matte black interior that will help reduce reflections for optimal image quality. Additionally, it has an integrated tripod foot with a 1/4""-20 socket that can be used to reduce stress on the camera's lens mount when using larger lenses.

<b>Vello LAE-SE-NFV4 Auto Lens Adapter Lens Compatibility Information (Firmware Ver. 4)</b>
</p><p>The following Nikon lenses and Sony cameras have been tested with the Vello LAE-SE-NF lens adapter for photo compatibility, some with operational limitations. If a lens is not listed, it might not work properly. We'll be testing more lenses and cameras and adding them to this table, so check back for future updates and firmware upgrades.

Vello,N,1295246,"Pair your existing Canon EF-mount full-frame lenses with a modern Sony E-mount mirrorless camera and experience the coveted ""full-frame look"" on APS-C format sensors with the Accelerator AF Lens Adapter from Vello. By using a specialized 4 element in 4 group optical design, this adapter is able to increase a lens' angle of view by a factor of 0.71x while simultaneously increasing the maximum aperture by one whole stop. This allows a 50mm f/1.4 lens on an APS-C camera to maintain an angle of view close to 50mm while providing it with an f/1.0 equivalent aperture. This setup means full-frame lenses can be adapted to APS-C sensors, or full-frame cameras in APS-C crop mode, without losing the desired natural look of a full-frame system. Along with this, the adapter features electronic coupling, enabling autofocus, auto exposure, and other functions during use.

Automatic capabilities of the lens are fully maintained, allows for auto exposure, autofocus, and aperture control from the camera body. The adapter will also transfer Exif data to the camera for appropriate tagging of metadata for easier organization and editing. Along with all of these functions the durable metal adapter sports a removable tripod foot with 1/4""-20 socket for use on a tripod or support system, alleviating strain on the lens mount. Additionally, it has a matte black interior to prevent reflections from interfering with image quality.

The following Canon lenses and Sony cameras have been tested with the Vello LAG-NEX-CEF lens adapter for photo compatibility with some operational limitations. Tests were conducted in AF-S and center point-focusing. Some Sony cameras
use one or two types of focusing systems, and performance may vary.

If a lens is not listed, it might not work properly. Vello will be testing more lenses and cameras and adding them to this table, so check back for future updates and firmware upgrades.

      &#42;Note: 
Remove the adapter's attached tripod foot before mounting the EF 85mm f/1.2L II",,"Pair your existing Canon EF-mount full-frame lenses with a modern Sony E-mount mirrorless camera and experience the coveted ""full-frame look"" on APS-C format sensors with the <b>Accelerator AF Lens Adapter</b> from <B>Vello</b>. By using a specialized 4 element in 4 group optical design, this adapter is able to increase a lens' angle of view by a factor of 0.71x while simultaneously increasing the maximum aperture by one whole stop. This allows a 50mm f/1.4 lens on an APS-C camera to maintain an angle of view close to 50mm while providing it with an f/1.0 equivalent aperture. This setup means full-frame lenses can be adapted to APS-C sensors, or full-frame cameras in APS-C crop mode, without losing the desired natural look of a full-frame system. Along with this, the adapter features electronic coupling, enabling autofocus, auto exposure, and other functions during use.
<br><br>
Automatic capabilities of the lens are fully maintained, allows for auto exposure, autofocus, and aperture control from the camera body. The adapter will also transfer Exif data to the camera for appropriate tagging of metadata for easier organization and editing. Along with all of these functions the durable metal adapter sports a removable tripod foot with 1/4""-20 socket for use on a tripod or support system, alleviating strain on the lens mount. Additionally, it has a matte black interior to prevent reflections from interfering with image quality.
